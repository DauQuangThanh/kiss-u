## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Audience and tone (interactive mode)

When `KISS_AGENT_MODE=interactive` (the default), assume the user
has **limited technical background and limited domain knowledge**
— they may know basics but lack deep expertise in implementation
planning. Run this skill as a guided questionnaire:

- **One question at a time.** No walls of questions.
- **Yes / no first.** Phrase so `yes`, `no`, `not sure`, or `skip`
  is a valid answer.
- **Translate jargon, don't strip it.** Use the technical term but
  always pair it with a plain-English gloss the first time it
  appears.
- **Choices, not blank fields.** When yes/no isn't enough, offer
  2-4 lettered options (A/B/C/D) with one-line plain-language
  descriptions of the trade-off. Always include "Not sure — pick
  a sensible default".
- **Always recommend.** State the option you would pick and why in
  one sentence so the user can reply "yes" / "ok" to accept. Pull
  defaults from upstream artefacts (spec, architecture, ADRs,
  standards) before asking blank.
- **Show, don't ask.** When upstream artefacts already imply an
  answer, propose it as a pre-filled finding and ask for a
  yes / no confirmation rather than asking the user to fill in a
  blank.
- **`not sure` / `skip` triggers a sensible default**, marked
  "(default applied — confirm later)" in the artefact, and a debt
  entry in this skill's debt file.

When `KISS_AGENT_MODE=auto` (or `--auto`), skip the questionnaire
entirely: apply sensible defaults from upstream artefacts and log
decisions to the parent agent's decision log.

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before planning)**:

- Check if `.kiss/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_plan` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- When constructing slash commands from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `kiss.git.commit` → `/kiss-git-commit`.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):

    ```text
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```

  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):

    ```text
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```

- If no hooks are registered or `.kiss/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `{context.paths.docs}/standards.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Standards Check section from standards
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Standards Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

5. **Check for extension hooks**: After reporting, check if `.kiss/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
   - If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_plan` key
   - If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
   - Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
   - For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
     - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
     - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
   - When constructing slash commands from hook command names, replace dots (`.`) with hyphens (`-`). For example, `kiss.git.commit` → `/kiss-git-commit`.
   - For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
     - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):

       ```text
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Optional Hook**: {extension}
       Command: `/{command}`
       Description: {description}

       Prompt: {prompt}
       To execute: `/{command}`
       ```

     - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):

       ```text
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
       Executing: `/{command}`
       EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
       ```

   - If no hooks are registered or `.kiss/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Define interface contracts** (if project has external interfaces) → `/contracts/`:
   - Identify what interfaces the project exposes to users or other systems
   - Document the contract format appropriate for the project type
   - Examples: public APIs for libraries, command schemas for CLI tools, endpoints for web services, grammars for parsers, UI contracts for applications
   - Skip if project is purely internal (build scripts, one-off tools, etc.)

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Update the plan reference between the `<!-- KISS START -->` and `<!-- KISS END -->` markers in `CLAUDE.md` to point to the plan file created in step 1 (the IMPL_PLAN path)

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, updated agent context file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths for filesystem operations; use project-relative paths for references in documentation and agent context files
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

## Inputs

- **Feature Specification** (`{context.current.spec}`): current.spec.
  - If set: Read the specification file at this path.
  - If null: Search {context.paths.specs} for the most recent spec.md.
  - If not provided: Ask the user to provide a path to the specification or run /kiss-specify first.

## Outputs

- **Implementation Plan** (`{context.paths.plans}/{context.current.feature}/plan.md`): paths.plans}/current.feature}/plan.md.
  - Behavior: Write the plan file. If it exists and confirm_before_write is true, ask the user.
  - Overwrite guarded by `{context.preferences.confirm_before_write}`.

- **Research Findings** (`{context.paths.plans}/{context.current.feature}/research.md`): paths.plans}/current.feature}/research.md.
  - Behavior: Write research findings documenting design decisions.
  - Overwrite guarded by `{context.preferences.confirm_before_write}`.

- **Data Model** (`{context.paths.plans}/{context.current.feature}/data-model.md`): paths.plans}/current.feature}/data-model.md.
  - Behavior: Write entity definitions and relationships.
  - Overwrite guarded by `{context.preferences.confirm_before_write}`.

## Context Update

After this skill completes successfully, update `.kiss/context.yml`:

- Set current.plan to the path of the created plan file
- Set current.feature if inferred or confirmed during planning
- Leave all other current.* fields unchanged
- Do not modify paths.*or preferences.*

## Handoffs

- **Create Tasks**: run `/kiss-taskify` to continue the workflow.
- **Create Checklist**: run `/kiss-checklist` to continue the workflow.
