## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Audience and tone (interactive mode)

This skill is invoked from both **non-technical roles**
(project-manager, scrum-master) and technical roles (tester,
bug-fixer). When the audiences mix, target the **non-technical
audience** — it's the more constrained one. When
`KISS_AGENT_MODE=interactive` (the default), assume the user has
**no technical or business-domain background**. Run this skill as
a guided questionnaire:

- **One question at a time.** No walls of questions.
- **Yes / no first.** Phrase so `yes`, `no`, `not sure`, or `skip`
  is a valid answer.
- **No jargon.** Translate domain terms into everyday words. Don't
  ask "give me the dependency-ordered task graph" — ask "want me
  to break this work into a list of small steps in the right
  order?".
- **Choices, not blank fields.** When yes/no isn't enough, offer
  2-4 lettered options (A/B/C/D) with one-line everyday
  descriptions. Always include "Not sure — pick a sensible default".
- **Always recommend.** State the option you would pick and why in
  one sentence so the user can reply "yes" / "ok" to accept.
- **`not sure` / `skip` triggers a sensible default**, marked
  "(default applied — confirm later)" in `tasks.md`, and a debt
  entry in the parent agent's debt file.

When `KISS_AGENT_MODE=auto` (or `--auto`), skip the questionnaire
entirely: produce the dependency-ordered task list directly and
log decisions to the parent agent's decision log.

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before taskify generation)**:

- Check if `.kiss/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_taskify` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):

    ```text
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```

  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):

    ```text
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    
    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```

- If no hooks are registered or `.kiss/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (interface contracts), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map interface contracts to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `templates/task-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per user story
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

6. **Check for extension hooks**: After tasks.md is generated, check if `.kiss/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
   - If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_taskify` key
   - If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
   - Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
   - For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
     - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
     - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
   - For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
     - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):

       ```text
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Optional Hook**: {extension}
       Command: `/{command}`
       Description: {description}

       Prompt: {prompt}
       To execute: `/{command}`
       ```

     - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):

       ```text
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
       Executing: `/{command}`
       EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
       ```

   - If no hooks are registered or `.kiss/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label  
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Interfaces/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each interface contract → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each interface contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

## Inputs

- **Feature Specification** (`{context.current.spec}`): current.spec.
  - If set: Read the specification file.
  - If null: Search {context.paths.specs} for the most recent spec.md.
  - If not provided: Ask the user to run /kiss-specify first.

- **Implementation Plan** (`{context.current.plan}`): current.plan.
  - If set: Read the plan file.
  - If null: Search {context.paths.plans} for the most recent plan.md.
  - If not provided: Proceed with available artifacts; plan is recommended but not required.

## Outputs

- **Tasks List** (`{context.paths.tasks}/{context.current.feature}/tasks.md`): paths.tasks}/current.feature}/tasks.md.
  - Behavior: Write the task list file. If it exists and confirm_before_write is true, ask the user.
  - Overwrite guarded by `{context.preferences.confirm_before_write}`.

## Context Update

After this skill completes successfully, update `.kiss/context.yml`:

- Set current.tasks to the path of the created tasks file
- Leave all other current.* fields unchanged
- Do not modify paths.*or preferences.*

## Handoffs

- **Analyze For Consistency**: run `/kiss-verify-tasks` to continue the workflow.
- **Implement Project**: run `/kiss-implement` to continue the workflow.
